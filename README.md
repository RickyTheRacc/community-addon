PRs will be merged at Ricky's earliest convenience *provided* they follow these rules:
- The PRs must still build properly and not break the addon.
- No personal information of other users should be included in PRs.
- Accessing location, IP, etc is okay as long as it's not sent anywhere.
- No changes to the rules, gradle files, or github workflows

## The Readme may be edited past this point!
